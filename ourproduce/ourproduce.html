                <h2>lamb</h2>
                <p>A year for the sheep typically begins in October on Drivers Farms when a couple of rams are put into the field with the ewes, 
                    hoping to begin lambing at the start of March. During the winter period, the ewes are moved to our arable fields that have 
                    been planted with nutritious feed for them, such as stubble turnips, so when it comes around to lambing time in March, the ewes are in 
                    great shape to raise their lambs. Throughout the lambing period, the ewes are housed indoor at night, and outside in daytime, 
                    so that we can make sure that we are able to help the ewes whilst lambing. Once lambed, the ewe and her lambs stay indoors for a 
                    couple of weeks until the lambs are big enough to go out into the fields. This ensures that our lambs are 
                    able to cope with whatever weather is thrown their way. The lambs then stay out in the fields for the rest of 
                    their life feeding on grassland pasture only.</p>

                <p>The cows at Drivers Farms are all Limousin cattle - the Limousin breed originates from France and is well known for its health, 
                    adaptability and low fat beef. We chose the Limousin breed because they are great at coping with the meadowlands on which we 
                    let them range. Additionally, the breed's natural traits of good health reduces the requirement of our intervention, especially 
                    with antibiotics, which is a growing issue in the livestock industry.

                    Beginning from January, the herd is housed indoors in one of our barns to shelter the young calves and rest of the herd from the 
                    harsh winter conditions. Approaching the start of May, the herd is then released out into the fields around the farmyard to range 
                    and graze freely for 8 months of the year, until Novemeber time, when they must be housed indoors again.</p>

<p>Our sheep flock have been on the farm since 2008, grazing on the permanent pastures dotted around Sawston. The lambs raised on these 
    pastures are therefore 100% pasture-fed.
    </p>
    <p>Ever since Grandad John decided to change from milking to a beef cows, the farm has been home to a beautiful herd of Limousin cattle 
        who graze on the meadowland at the rear of the farmyard.
        </p>
        <p>Only recently, Richard made the decision to implement regenerative farming practices which aim to integrate, rehabilitate and protect 
            natural processes in our farming system.
            </p>
