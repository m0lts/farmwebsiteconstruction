                        <h3>Why farm sustainably?</h3>
                        <p>By farming sustainably and creating a synergistic relationship between our farm and the environment, we can create a more resilient food production system, 
                        enabling us to cope better with extreme weather conditions. Lately, new innovations in the farming sector have made sustainable farming more and more achievable to 
                        all farmers. These innovations have contributed to the discovery of a new set of farming practices, coined under the term 
                        "Regenerative Agriculture." Regenerative Agriculture involves a number of farming practices that all focus on sustainability, and result in a more resilient 
                        agricultural sector.</p>

                        <h3>What is Regenerative Agriculture?</h3>
                        <p>The main focus is to farm with maximum conservation and rehabilitation of the land and minimum 
                        disturbance to natural processes. Sounds simple right? That's because our distant ancestors used to farm in this manner before machinery and intensive agriculture was 
                        invented. However, the challenge nowadays is to find a perfect balance between minimum natural processes disruption and sufficient food production. The farming practices 
                        listed below to try to achieve that perfect balance.</p>

                        <h3>Cover Crops</h3>
                        <p>Instead of leaving bare soil for months after harvest, we choose to plant cover crops in our fields. These can be a variety of crops but we like to choose cover crops that 
                            both help to regenerate our soil and those that benefit the local ecology, such as birds and small mammals. By planting cover crops and farming more naturally, we reduce our reliance on 
                            artificial inputs by 10% on average each year, and do our bit for climate change by sequestering carbon dioxide all year round.

                        <h3>Minimum Tillage</h3>
                        <p>Traditional agriculture previously relied on ploughing to prepare the seed bed for the next crop, heavily disturbing the soil. However, we choose not to plough where we can to 
                            reduce soil disturbance to a minimum. Minimum soil disturbance means more goodness (carbon dioxide and various fertilisers) is kept in the soil for the next crop. Additionally, 
                            by not disturbing the soil structure, we improve soil drainage and microbiology richness which helps to protect the local environment from extreme weather.

                        <h3>Livestock Integration</h3>
                        <p>Because we are a mixed farm, we aim to integrate our livestock and arable enterprises as much as possible. One example is by growing cover crops on our arable fields that the 
                            sheep flock can graze on. This is both great for the health of our flock but also the health of the soil as natural processes are taking place. Another example is more common - 
                            we spread our cattle's manure on our fields because it is full of fertiliser for the crops, further reducing our reliance on artificial fertilisers.
